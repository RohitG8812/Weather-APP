## Introduction
The Weather Report is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city worldwide.

The displayed data includes the city's temperature, humidity, weather description, and a visual representation using an image.

## Features

- **Real-time Data:** The application fetches and displays real-time weather data.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
- **Weather Description:** The weather condition is described in simple terms, such as clear, cloudy, rain, etc.
- **Temperature Details:** Displays current temperature, humidity, and feels-like temperature.
